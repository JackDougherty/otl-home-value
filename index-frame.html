  <p>Click the tabs (or use arrow keys) to see how the most valuable single-family homes (in dark green) shifted from the City of Hartford to selected suburbs over the decades. Hover over towns to view the home value index (where county average = 1.0), which adjusts for inflation over time. Missing values appear in gray.
