  <p>Click on years (or press arrow keys) to see how the most valuable single-family homes (in dark green) shifted from the City of Hartford to selected suburbs over the decades. Hover over towns to view the home value index (where county average = 1.0), which adjusts for inflation over time. Missing values appear in gray. View <a href="http://github.com/jackdougherty/otl-home-value">source data and the code</a>. Learn more at <a href="http://OnTheLine.trincoll.edu">OnTheLine.trincoll.edu</a>.</p>
